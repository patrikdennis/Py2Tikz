TODO
- Need to handle if the user doesn't provide any comment e.g. `plot_config = [{"x": foo_x,  "y": foo_y }] `. Atm user can provide `plot_config = [{"comment": "", "options": "",  "x": foo_x,  "y": foo_y , "legend": " "}] ` [DONE]
- Should make the config options and setup more user friendly. Need to make each option seperate and easy to write. 
- Need to handle if user wants multiple plots.
